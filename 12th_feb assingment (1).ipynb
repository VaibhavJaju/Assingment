    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are used to handle errors and other exceptional conditions that can arise while a program is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error, on the other hand, is a type of error that occurs when the code written in the program violates the rules of the Python syntax. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the code is executed, and they prevent the program from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between an exception and a syntax error is that exceptions occur at runtime, while syntax errors occur at compile time. Additionally, syntax errors are usually easier to detect and fix because they prevent the code from being executed, whereas exceptions can be more difficult to debug because they occur only when the code is running.\n",
