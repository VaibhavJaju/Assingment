    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database system that stores data in a flexible, semi-structured JSON-like format called BSON. Unlike traditional relational databases like SQL, MongoDB uses a flexible data model that allows for easier scalability and performance.\n",

    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that store data in a non-tabular format. Unlike relational databases, which use a structured table format with rows and columns, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family. NoSQL databases are often used for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and for scenarios where data needs to be horizontally scaled across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Scalability is a concern: MongoDB's flexible data model and horizontal scaling capabilities make it easier to scale across multiple servers without the need for complex data sharding or partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Semi-structured data: MongoDB's document-oriented data model is well-suited for handling semi-structured or unstructured data, such as data from social media, sensor data, or product catalogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Real-time data processing: MongoDB's write-intensive architecture is well-suited for real-time data processing scenarios, such as logging, content management, or online gaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Agile development: MongoDB's dynamic schema makes it easier to add or modify fields as the application evolves, providing greater flexibility for agile development teams."

    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database system that offers many features that make it well-suited for modern web and mobile applications. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Document-oriented data model: MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model that stores data in flexible, semi-structured JSON-like documents called BSON. This allows for easier scalability and performance compared to traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Indexing: MongoDB provides a rich set of indexing options that allow for efficient data access and faster queries. These include single-field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)High availability: MongoDB supports replica sets, which allow for automatic failover in the event of a server outage. This provides high availability and ensures that applications remain up and running even in the face of hardware failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Horizontal scaling: MongoDB can be horizontally scaled across multiple servers using a process called sharding. This allows for increased data throughput and improved performance as the application grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Aggregation and analytics: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex data processing and analytics. This includes support for grouping, filtering, and transformation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)Flexibility: MongoDB's dynamic schema allows for easy addition or modification of fields as the application evolves. This provides greater flexibility and agility for modern development teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "7)Multi-document transactions: Starting from version 4.0, MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, allowing developers to perform multiple operations on multiple documents in a single transaction. This ensures data consistency and helps to prevent data anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)Security: MongoDB provides several security features, including role-based access control, encryption at rest, and network encryption. This ensures that data is secure and protected from unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB provides a powerful and flexible database solution for modern web and mobile applications. Its document-oriented data model, indexing, high availability, horizontal scaling, aggregation, flexibility, multi-document transactions, and security features make it a popular choice among developers and organizations.\n",

    "Here's a brief explanation of each of these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)delete_one(): This method is used to remove a single document from a collection. It takes a dictionary as its parameter, which specifies the criteria to match for the document to be deleted. If multiple documents match the criteria, only the first one will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)delete_many(): This method is used to remove multiple documents from a collection. Like delete_one(), it takes a dictionary as its parameter to specify the criteria for matching documents. All documents that match the criteria will be deleted.\n",

These methods are useful when you need to remove unwanted data from your database or start fresh with a new collection.
